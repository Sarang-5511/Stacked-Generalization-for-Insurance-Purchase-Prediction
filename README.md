Stacked-Generalization-for-Insurance-Purchase-Prediction



The Caravan Insurance dataset, sourced from the CoIL 2000 data
mining competition, involves a binary classification challenge:
predicting whether a customer is likely to buy a caravan insurance
policy. This dataset includes numerous socio-demographic and
insurance-specific variables, making feature selection and
achieving high model accuracy, particularly challenging due to
issues like class imbalance and data complexity. This study
investigates the effectiveness of stacking—a technique for
combining multiple models—in improving prediction accuracy.
By incorporating diverse algorithms such as Naïve Bayes,
Gaussian Classifier, Neural Networks, SVM, Random Forest, and
Gradient Boosting, the ensemble approach takes advantage of
each model’s unique strengths. Findings reveal that stacking,
when paired with targeted feature selection and data
transformation, substantially enhances model performance on this
imbalanced dataset.
